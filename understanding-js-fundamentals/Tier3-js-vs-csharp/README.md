# Tier 3 â€” Comparing JavaScript and C#

## Key Comparison Points
| Concept |   JavaScript    | C# |
|---------|-----------------|----|
| Typing  | Dynamic         | Static |
| Runtime | Browser/Node.js | Compiled (CLR) |
|Functions| First-class     | Must be in a class |
|Variables| `let`, `const`  | `int`, `string`, `var` |
|Objects  | Prototype-based | Class-based |

### Example Code
See `compare.js` and `compare.cs` for similar function logic in both languages.

### Challenge
Write a short explanation (in your own words) about one key similarity and one difference between JS and C#.
